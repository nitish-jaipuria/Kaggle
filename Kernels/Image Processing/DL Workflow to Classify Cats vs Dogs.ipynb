For the theoretical explanations, I have referred to [Deep Learning with Python Book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) and some online articles as and when required.\n\nI have also tried to run some experiments by changing parameters, but due to slow execution time in the kernel, its limited.\n\nOverall the workflow has the following steps.\n\n1. Loading required libraries\n2. Specifying the components of the Sequential Classifier (CNN Model)\n3. Load Training and Test data, also perform data augmentation\n4. Fit the model and obtain results.\n\nHope some beginners will find it useful!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is a CNN model and why is it useful for image classification?\n\nI won't go into the gory mathematical details, if interested there are many resources available in form of books (e.g. Deep Learning Book) or online blogs.\n\nThe USP of the CNN modelling technique is the *convolution* operation.
